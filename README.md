# MLModelEvaluator

## Description
MLModelEvaluator is a Python-based tool designed to simplify the process of training and evaluating regression models. Users can easily load datasets, handle missing values, choose from multiple regression models, and get insights into model performance via cross-validation, R2 score, and mean squared error. Additionally, this tool provides a visualization of true vs predicted values, offering a clearer understanding of model behavior. Once satisfied, users can save their trained models for future predictions or deployment.

## Features
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Streamlined data loading from CSV, with an interactive method to handle missing values.
- **Model Selection:** Users can choose from Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial Regression, or Logistic Regression.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluate model performance using cross-validation, R2 score, and mean squared error.
- **Visualization:** Plot true vs. predicted values to visually assess model accuracy.
- **Model Saving:** Option to save the trained model in a .pkl format for future use.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `MLModelEvaluator.py`.
3. Follow the interactive prompts to load data, preprocess, select a model, and evaluate.
4. Optionally, save the model for future use.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
